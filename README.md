# LB Chess Extension
A LioranBoard extension to play chess with your viewers or between them.

The extension includes a pretty complex deck to play, fully controllable with chat commands. Also allows an easy translation to your language.

Read carefully the documentation on how to set up the game and how to use it.

# Set up
1. Download the zip file from releases. The file contains a .lbe file (the extension) and 13 pgn files (the 12 pieces and the chessboard).
2. Place the pgns in any folder where they will be safe (if you delete those files the game will not work).
3. Install the lbe extension. [Check this documentation if you don't know how.](https://christinna9031.github.io/LBDocumentation/setup.html#extensions). It will install a new deck called "ChessGame by SebasF". The next steps will use buttons of this deck.
4. Buttons in the deck have 4 different colours:
    * **Black buttons**: Used for the setup. The one at the bottom opens the documentation (this site) for you, in case you need it to reinstall or make some changes.
    * **Red buttons**: Buttons you can use in your streamdeck (although it's better to use chat commands).
    * **Green buttons**: Buttons that are executes by the players. Don't press them in the streamdeck.
    * **Blue buttons**: Just titles so you know what the green buttons in the left do. They don't do anything.
5. First you need to complete the "Messages and Translation" button.
